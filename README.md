# python-memory-game
A simple GUI memory game made with Tkinter.

This repository was forked from https://github.com/kate-somi/python-memory-game, which I would like to thank for their contribution.

## Usage

This game needs Tkinter. Depending on your distribution, you might need to install it with `sudo apt install python3-tk`.

To run the game, use `python main.py`.

## Exercise

The game had bugs introduced on purpose, to demonstrate the ability to work on multiple feature in parallel using git, and how to work with Pull Requests (or Merge Requests).
All errors are marked with `TODO` comments, and should be simple to fix, requiring very little programming knowledge or Python expertise as this is not the purpose of the exercise.
